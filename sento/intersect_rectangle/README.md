# Challenge 1: Algorithms - Intersecting Rectangles

## Description

You have a JSON that contains the coordinates of two rectangles. Using the JSON as input, you should determine whether any specified rectangles intersect or not.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Best practice:** Use best practices of your chosen language
- **Auditability:** Show us how you work through your commit history
- **Completeness:** did you complete the features? Are all the unit tests running?
- **Correctness:** does the functionality act insensible, thought-out ways?
- **Maintainability:** is it written in a clean, maintainable way?

## Result

The description as a module docstring: see the file `./src/intersect.py`.

To run tests:

- install the module `pyhamcrest`, https://pypi.org/project/PyHamcrest/
- install the linter `flake8`
- run the linter and tests:

```
make
```
